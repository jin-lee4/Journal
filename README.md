This application can be used by anyone who is interested in a
simple way to keep a journal in an organized manner.  

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me because I am someone who avidly
journals, therefore I would genuinely love to have an application like 
this! I feel this application would be very useful in keeping a record
of one's life without the hassle of a physical book and/or keeping 
it organized. Furthermore, this project will be a great learning
experience.
